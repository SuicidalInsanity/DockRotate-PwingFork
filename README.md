# DockRotate

A hacked version of peteletroll's DockRotate hacked to serve as a a rotation controller for building swingWings with intrinsic servos, no need for Breaking Ground and its floppy joints.

Changes the rotation commands to a clamped min and max, trying to rotate past the max will toggle rotation direction.
Adds a Speed controller for automatically swinging wings based on current airspeed, no need for smartPart Action Groups
